# GA-SHADE-MOv2

This is a source code of the improved proposed erlier evolutionary-based multi-objective algorithm, GA-SHADE-MOv2, for simultaneously tuning hyper-parameters of an ML algorithm and the used set of features. As an example, the XGBoost regression algortihm was taken to be optimized using GA-SHADE-MOv2.

The folder with the results of the numerical experiments has been uploaded.
