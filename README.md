# GA-SHADE-MOv2

This is a source code of the improved proposed erlier evolutionary-based multi-objective algorithm. A novel version is named as GA-SHADE-MOv2. It uses for simultaneously tuning hyper-parameters and the used set of features of an ML models. As an example, the XGBoost regression algortihm was taken to be optimized using GA-SHADE-MOv2.

The folder with the results of the numerical experiments has been uploaded.

Before, a paper is not published in a journal/conference. Please, use the following references of early proposed GA-SHADE and GA-SHADE-MO:
